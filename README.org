* GridFire

GridFire is a raster-based fire behavior model that may be used to
simulate the spread of wildland fires across a landscape, either
individually or in monte carlo simulations over space and time. For
inputs, it requires a stack of co-registered raster maps for your area
of interest as well as a text configuration file that specifies
various parameters necessary for the simulation.

* Usage

GridFire has been coded as a literate program
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) using Emacs'
org-mode (http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/). Full
documentation of the current system can always be found in the *org*
directory within this repository:

- org/GridFire.org :: Literate Program Source Code
